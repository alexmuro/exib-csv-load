Checklist for NAHB import:


X First, remove exhibitor_booths for all exhibitors in the file (* not all exhibitors for the show)
  xLoop through all the rows, get all the import ids, for each import id, match on tbl_exhibitor_show and remove all the exhibitor_booths that match
  x Convert special characters from macro to html entities 
  
- Then, loop through again to start import
  
  - always update the exhibiting_as column
  - if the tbl_exhibitor_show.allowupdate column = 1 then don't update any other columns on tbl_exhibitor_show or tbl_exhibitor_contact, but we always update exhibitor_booths and tbl_exhibitor_show.exhibiting_as
  - remove http(s):// from website urls
  - Building column determines which map the booths belong to
    - Central goes to _ map_id
    - North goes to _ map_id
    - Parking Lot goes to _ map_id


    
  - If an exhibitor doesn't exist, we need to create them. The tbl_exhibitor_contact record needs to be created with a contact_type of 'directory'. 
    - Look to see if there is an exhibitor in tbl_exhibitors with that name.
      - If there is, just use that id for exhibitor_id on tbl_exhibitor_show
      - If not, create it
  - When updating existing records on tbl_exhibitor_contact, update the one with the type 'directory'
  - Note: there may be multiple rows per import id. If that happens, it means there are multiple booths for that exhibitor
  - tbl_exhibitor_show.lastupdate should always be set with a timestamp
